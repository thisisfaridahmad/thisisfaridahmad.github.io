            <div id="morep">
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML was the first language that I learned by using Google, YouTube, SoloLearn, W3School, freecodecamp and lots of books and videos. To be honest these sources helped me to learn almost all of the skills that you see here. I stated learning HTML just for fun to see what it is and what I can do with it. Now when I look back, learning this language was pretty much the start of my journey</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id='moretext1'>
            <span id="closediv1" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>After learning HTML I was so excited to desgin the webpages that I was making. Well, the best language to desgin webpages, in my opinion is CSS. Therefore I wanted to know more about CSS but during learning and practicing I found out that the pages which I was desgining wasn't responsive at ALL, ehem but not to forget those were pretty but yeah I know still irresponsive.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id='moretext2'>
            <span id="closediv2" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>When I was using CSS to design webpages they were pretty, as I said in the last part but irresponsive so the only main reason that I learned Bootstrap was becuase of responsivness</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id='moretext3'>
            <span id="closediv3" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Finally my first programming language, I was so thrilled to learn JavaScript because from the beginning of learning HTML I wanted to say that I am a programmer, so silly I know but anyway when I begun studying this languages at first it was very confusing I admit but after a while I can say that I am an expert ehm I mean I am a little good at it</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id='moretext4'>
            <span id="closediv4" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>Jquery</h3>
                <p>With Jquery it is easy to write less and do more. Back at the days when I was writing lots of code in JavaScript, I would lose lots of time therefore I was looking for a way that I could write less and expect more and luckly there was a framework like that, Jquery. the first days that I was using Jquery I was like everyone is stupid except me.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div id='moretext5'>
            <span id="closediv5" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>XML and JSON</h3>
                <p>These guys is easy to learn and takes less time to understand so learned it</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div id="moretext2.0">
            <span id="closediv2.0" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>PHP</h3>
                <p>One day I was reading about PHP and the things this language is capable of, so eventually I ended up learning it, and of course knowing with PHP I can work with server and make my webpages more dynamic also got me excited</p>
            </div>
        </div>        

        <div id="moretext2.1">
            <span id="closediv2.1" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>MySQL</h3>
                <p>In my opinion everyone should learn MySQL after or maybe during learning PHP, because after mixing these guys togather you can understand why it is so powerful and popular</p>
            </div>
        </div>        

        <div id="moretext2.2">
            <span id="closediv2.2" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>C++</h3>
                <p>At first the main reason for me to learn C++ was to make high quality games but you know game development needs so much time so instead of focusing on game I begun to try new things and see how far I can go with it as a result I can tell you, this language sometimes may tempt you to break your computer especialy while working with pointers and data struct but offers lots of power.</p>
            </div>
        </div>        

        <div id="moretext2.3">
            <span id="closediv2.3" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Hearing a lot of compliments about python made me wonder is this lanuguage really worth trying and learning therefore I begun searching, turns out that most of those compliments that you might (if you are a programmer) hear about python is true except the part of being fast. P.S I strongly suggest you to start learning it, super easy and powerful</p>
            </div>
        </div>        

        <div id="moretext2.4">
            <span id="closediv2.4" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>Metasploit</h3>
                <p>As I was making myself comfortable using Linux I came across a tool called metasploit at first I really didn't know what that is but now I can say it is a great pranking tool to get into your friends devices and scare them. After learning the basics of CCNA and how the routers along with IPs work, by using this tool I didn't know, but you become a hacker well sort of. pufff Mind blowing right?. On my way to learn more...</p>

        <div id="moretext2.5">
            <span id="closediv2.5" class="btn">&times;</span>
            <div id="morep">
                <h3>Linux, CCNA</h3>
                <p>Learning Linux by far is one of the best decesions of My life for serveral reasons.<br> One: After working with Linux I could secure my webpages and of course the devices that I have.<br>
                Second: As I dive deeper into Linux I found out that learning how the Internet works is a must. so I started gathering as much information as I could (for free) to learn CCNA and Network.
                Third: Knowing how to work with Burpsuit, metasploit, hashcat and etc...
